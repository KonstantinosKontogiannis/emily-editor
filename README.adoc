:name: Markup editor

= {name}

{name} is a React editor component for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language[LML]s, like Markup or Asciidoc.
The focus of the project is to provide fluent efficient interface for advanced users, who are familliar with using IDE or coding text editors.

== Usage

The project is in early stage of development.
It shall be beundled and published when I find it is ready for use.

=== Running locally

You can run it now in dev mode `npm run dev`.

== Heroku

Heroku seems not tu run `npm run build` when it builds.
To do that, add link:https://github.com/romeovs/heroku-buildpack-npm-build[Heroku Buildpack npm build] as Heroku buildpack.
If using Github CI, you must use Heroku WUI (at least I think).

== Contributing

If you feel like it, do add feature requests, or bug report in https://github.com/grissius/markup-editor/issues[issue tracker].

Much obliged!c
